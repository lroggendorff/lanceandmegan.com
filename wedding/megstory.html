<p><em>The Luckiest</em><br />
<small>Dedicated to my Love</small></p>
<p>
I don&rsquo;t believe in love at first sight, but if I did, that&rsquo;s how I would describe my falling for Lance. Sometimes when I look at him now I can hardly believe this is the man I am going to marry. How is God so good to me? I could ponder it for a lifetime. In fact, I know I will.</p>
<p>It started like this. I was a cranky girl in high school who had a broken empty heart and no idea what it meant to be loved. However, I was talented, and I was playing the lead role in my final high school play; my shining moment. After the play was over, our cast went out to perform our traditional routine of greeting all the audience members while still in costume. I was standing there looking ridiculous in a bright blonde wig and oversized shirt and as I looked up my eyes fell on&hellip;you guessed it&hellip;him. It felt like he was standing in a beam of light from Heaven, and all the other people in the room disappeared. I remember it all, the way his hair looked, the way he was standing, the shirt he wore, but most of all I remember his smile. I have never been the same.</p>
<p>To squeeze two years into this story, I can only say that my best friend had finally arrived. He re-introduced me to Jesus and was one of God&rsquo;s steps to leading me out of the loneliness I had nurtured throughout high school. I never stopped having a crush on him, but his feelings for me were not the same. I loved him so much though, as my true friend, that I kept working to lay my feelings for him aside. It was not easy. After a year and a half, I felt defeated, as if I were doomed to an unrequited love forever. But God had other plans.</p>
<p>God used that time to show me that He was the only One who could satisfy me, and I had been waiting for Lance to be my knight in shining armor, a task that was impossible for any mortal man. The Lord taught me how to rely on Him for not only everything I needed, but also for everything I wanted. So much time passed, and not suddenly, but gradually, my feelings for Lance subsided. I was learning new things about God, and I was excited about where I was going with Him. I got to a place where I could honestly say I was going to be okay if it was only Jesus and me for the rest of my life. Lance stopped looking so much like my savior, and began looking like really just my friend. And then something incredible happened.</p>
<p>After two years of trying and trying, pursuing Lance and wanting so much to make him love me, I was finally over him. And he fell in love with me. Just like that. The Lord knows exactly what He is doing, even though sometimes I do not have a clue! It took some time, but eventually those feelings that had finally gone away came back, and we started dating one cold midnight, December 1, under a sky full of sparkling stars. We&rsquo;ve been dating ever since, and on December 27th, two years after that cold midnight, he proposed, the most perfect, romantic proposal you could imagine, and now I&rsquo;m writing out our story for our wedding website!</p>
<p>I realized my mistake sometime well into our relationship. God&rsquo;s way is like this. If we pursue Him with all our heart, we allow ourselves to surrender to His mad-crazy-love. I was pursuing the wrong god. Jesus loved me too much to let me worship someone who could never fulfill my deepest desires, no matter how hard he tried. And when I got that, when my pursuit and my god changed, the Lord delivered the most inspiring, romantic, beautiful, passionate, loving, sincere, sensitive, perfect man for me to have and to hold. And now I&rsquo;m the luckiest girl in the world.</p>
